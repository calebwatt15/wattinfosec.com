Summary: Caleb is a pen tester who enjoys learning new aspects of informations ecurity

I am an information security professional. I've worked in the industry professionally since 2014. Most of my professional experience is in Web Application security, though I also work frequently with thick clients and SAP instances. In my spare time, I like to write things in C, reverse binaries, and practice physical security, such as lockpicking or bypassing techniques.
