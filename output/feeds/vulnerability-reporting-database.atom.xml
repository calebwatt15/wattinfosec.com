&lt;p&gt;I felt that there was lack of a decent open-sourced vulnerability database for writing vulnerability reports. CWE is kind of close, but does not have enough detail for specifics. This project is designed to fill that gap, and allow smaller shops to have a template for vulnerability reporting, without the resources of larger shops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that nearly every vulnerability assessment shop has their own proprietary vulnerability reporting database. HP has one, IOActive has one, Whitehat has one. They all specialize and write custom vulnerability descriptions based on their expertise. This is all well and good. It makes their report writing immensely easier, and from what I have seen, they all have pretty good reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured report writing is something rarely covered in new Tester education, and there are very few Vuln databases that do not focus on particular vulnerabilities. &lt;a href="http://osvdb.org/" title="OSVDB"&gt;OSVDB&lt;/a&gt; has thousands of particular vulnerabilities, and &lt;a href="https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/search" title="NVD CVE"&gt;NVD CVE&lt;/a&gt; likewise has many known specific vulnerabilities, but if a vulnerability assessor is performing a test and finds a buffer overflow in a client-built application, that specific vulnerability is likely not in OSVDB or does not have a CVE. As such, the tester would benefit from having a default description and solution for that finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, I have started writing the Vulnerability Reporting Database, or 
&lt;a href="https://github.com/calebwatt15/vrdb" title="vrdb"&gt;vrdb&lt;/a&gt;. 
It is (at this time) written in JSON, should be easily portable across many languages (many have a JSON parser) At this time, the database is small (there are only a handful of vulnerabilities in it that I have inserted during testing.) Most of them are Web Application vulnerabilities, using mostly descriptions and solutions from OWASP. I do plan on adding many more types of vulnerabilities, such as thick client, network, SAP, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the database, I have written a simple &lt;a href="https://github.com/calebwatt15/vrdbTool" title="vrdbTool"&gt;python script&lt;/a&gt; to write the JSON so I do not misformat it, that can also be found on GitHub. It is pretty hacky at this point, and is a project unto itself. Since the code in it is not very good, it should remain seperate  from the vrdb proper.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="vrdb"></category><category term="project"></category></entry></feed>
